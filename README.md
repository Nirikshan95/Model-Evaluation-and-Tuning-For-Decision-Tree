# Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of evaluating machine learning models and tuning their hyperparameters to optimize performance. Using the Iris dataset, we implemented cross-validation, grid search, and evaluated the model using various metrics.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is used in this project. It contains 150 instances of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the target class.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using:
 pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

## Usage
Run the `model_evaluation_tuning.py` script to see the model evaluation and tuning process in action. Modify the hyperparameters in the script to experiment with different configurations.

## Results
The results of the model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning are documented in the output section of the script. Analyze the performance metrics to understand the impact of different parameters.
